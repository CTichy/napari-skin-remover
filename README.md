# ZF-Microglia-AI

A [napari](https://napari.org) plugin for automated 3D brain extraction and AI-assisted microglia segmentation and analysis from *Danio rerio* (zebrafish) confocal stacks.

Developed at **FH Technikum Wien** — Artificial Intelligence & Data Science.

**Documentation:** this README (quick reference) · [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) (full user guide, GUIDE.pdf also available) · [STATISTICS_GUIDE.md](STATISTICS_GUIDE.md) (Tab 3 statistics — the algorithm/formula behind every CSV column, STATISTICS_GUIDE.pdf also available)

---

## What it does

Given a 3D confocal volume (TIF or IMS), the plugin provides five tabs:

- **Tab 1 — Skin Remover:** runs a trained MONAI U-Net to predict the brain mask, removes the skin, and saves `brain_mask.tif` + `brain_only.tif`
- **Tab 2 — Create Labels:** two ways to detect and label individual microglia in 3D. **Cellpose-SAM Segmentation** (`do_3D` inference → 3-component GMM cleanup → Krendl safe-merge → large-contact merge) is the recommended path — a fine-tuned foundation model that handles branching/overlapping cells far better than classical thresholding. The **Pixel Classifier** (Gaussian smooth → threshold → overlap-based union-find 3D stitching → volume filter) is a lighter, older-technology fallback for machines with no GPU at all. The tab automatically shows whichever one matches your active layer's background-removal mode (see below) — no manual switching needed.
- **Tab 3 — Statistics:** computes up to 51 morphological, spatial, and intensity features per labelled cell and exports a CSV. Always visible — shows an explanatory hint in place of the controls until at least one Labels layer exists, the same "explain instead of hide" pattern as Tab 2's method sections.
- **Tab 4 — AI Tools:** ground-truth polygon annotation plus launchers for MONAI and Cellpose-SAM training (dataset prep/crop extraction, hours-to-days training runs that survive napari closing). Always available — shows a disclaimer banner instead of hiding if your GPU is missing or under the recommended 8GB — see below.
- **Tab 5 — Sweeps & Utilities:** every GT-verification sweep tool (one per pipeline stage: MONAI segmentation, Pixel Classifier smoothing, Pixel Classifier labelling, Cellpose-SAM labelling, Cellpose-SAM checkpoint selection) plus two adjacent GT utilities, consolidated in one place instead of scattered across Tabs 1-4. Each tool still operates on its own tab's parameters and auto-applies its findings back there — this tab doesn't introduce a separate workflow, it just keeps the day-to-day tabs focused on running the pipeline rather than tuning it.

## Environment setup (first time)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CTichy/ZF-Microglia-AI.git
cd ZF-Microglia-AI
```

### 2. Create the environment

**Windows / Linux (CUDA GPU):**
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

**Mac (CPU / Apple MPS):**
```bash
conda env create -f environment-mac.yml
```

### 3. Activate and launch

```bash
conda activate zf-microglia-ai
napari
```

Then: **Plugins → ZF-Microglia-ToolKit (ZF-Microglia-AI)**

---

## Updating (subsequent runs)

```bash
cd ZF-Microglia-AI
git pull
conda env update --name zf-microglia-ai -f environment.yml --prune   # or environment-mac.yml on Mac
```

> **Windows / Linux (CUDA GPU):** after every `conda env update`, restore the correct torch:
> ```bash
> pip install "torch==2.7.0+cu126" "torchvision==0.22.0+cu126" \
>   --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
> ```
> (run this with the `zf-microglia-ai` env active — `conda env update` ignores `--extra-index-url` in environment.yml and resets torch to the wrong version. Not needed on Mac, which doesn't use CUDA torch.)

---

## Developing the plugin (editable install)

The steps above install a fixed snapshot from GitHub — fine for using the plugin, but source edits won't take effect until you reinstall. For active development, install the local clone in editable mode instead:

```bash
cd ZF-Microglia-AI
conda activate zf-microglia-ai
pip install -e .
```

Source edits now take effect the next time napari launches — no reinstall needed. Verify it's picking up the local clone (not a stale `site-packages` copy):

```bash
python -c "import napari_zf_microglia_ai; print(napari_zf_microglia_ai.__file__)"
```

This should print a path inside your cloned `ZF-Microglia-AI/` folder, not inside `site-packages`.

---

## Model files

This plugin needs **two** trained checkpoints — neither is bundled in the repo. Quick setup:

```
YourPluginFolder/            <- anywhere convenient, e.g. next to your cloned repo
├── models/
│   ├── MONAI/
│   │   └── best_model_fullstack.pth
│   └── Cellpose/
│       └── <your checkpoint>
```

This exact layout isn't required — the plugin remembers whatever path you browse to via the **Browse (...)** buttons in Tabs 1/2, so any location works. `models/MONAI/` and `models/Cellpose/` is just a tidy default if you'd rather not decide.

### MONAI skin-removal model (required, Tab 1)

A trained `.pth` checkpoint — **not included in this repo** (~220 MB).

1. Download [best_model_fullstack.pth](https://cloud.technikum-wien.at/s/kYQ4qq3Jsn4xEyY).
2. Move it into `models/MONAI/` (or anywhere else you prefer).
3. In the plugin, Tab 1 → **Browse (...)** → select the file. The path is remembered across sessions.

### Cellpose-SAM checkpoint (recommended, Tab 2)

Needed for **Cellpose-SAM Segmentation**, the recommended labelling method (see above). This is a project-specific fine-tuned Cellpose-SAM model (~580 MB), branch-weighted 3-fish checkpoint (`multi3_bw`, epoch 150).

1. Download [cpsam_microglia_512_multi3_bw_epoch_0150](https://cloud.technikum-wien.at/s/eFBJepk9DakDxyb).
2. Move it into `models/Cellpose/`.
3. In the plugin, Tab 2 → Cellpose-SAM Segmentation section → **Browse (...)** → select the file. The path is remembered across sessions.

If your machine has no GPU at all, use the **Pixel Classifier** instead — it needs no additional model file and no GPU, but is a lighter, older-technology approach; only fall back to it when a GPU genuinely isn't available.

### Training scripts (Tab 4 — AI Tools only)

Tab 4 launches three project-specific research scripts (`prepare_data.py`, `train.py`, `train_xzyz.py`) as separate subprocesses. They ship with the plugin — bundled under `napari_zf_microglia_ai/training_scripts/` and installed as package data — so they're present for every install method (plain `git+https://` install or editable). If you want to point at a locally modified copy instead, the config file (`~/.config/napari-zf-microglia-ai/config.json`) has `monai_prepare_script_path`/`monai_train_script_path`/`cellpose_train_script_path` keys to override.

---

## Tab 1 — Skin Remover

### Workflow

1. **Open a file** — click "Open TIF / IMS file". All channels load as separate layers.
2. **Select the channel** to process by clicking its layer in the Layers panel.
3. **Browse to the model** `.pth` file if not auto-detected.
4. **Adjust MONAI Threshold** (default 0.25).
5. **Choose Background mode** — pick **Option 1 (Remove outside brain only, `_ExtRm`)** if you plan to segment with **Cellpose-SAM** in Tab 2, or **Option 2 (Remove globally, `_NoBG`)** if you plan to use the **Pixel Classifier**. Tab 2 auto-detects which one you produced and shows the matching tool.
6. Click **Run Skin-Remover**.

All numeric sliders in this plugin are directly editable — click the number box next to any slider and type an exact value instead of dragging.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| MONAI Threshold | 0.25 | Sigmoid cutoff. Keep low — post-processing cleans the rest. |
| Erosion | 0 vox | Strips skin rim from `brain_only`. `brain_mask` always saved un-eroded. Composes correctly with any Background mode — a prior version silently discarded Erosion whenever a Background mode was active, fixed as of this version. |
| Background mode | Off | 1 for Cellpose-SAM, 2 for Pixel Classifier (see Tab 2) |
| BG Threshold | 1.40 | Validated for microglia stacks |

**Verify MONAI Threshold / Erosion (GT Sweep)** — moved to **Tab 5 — Sweeps & Utilities**; recalibrates the Threshold/Erosion sliders above directly from a hand-corrected GT brain mask.

### Output files

Saved in `<source_folder>/<source_stem>/`:

| File | Content | Feeds into (Tab 2) |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `*_brain_only.tif` | Volume with everything outside the brain zeroed | — |
| `*_brain_only_ExtRm.tif` | Background removed outside the brain only (Mode 1) | Cellpose-SAM Segmentation |
| `*_brain_only_NoBG.tif` | Background also removed inside the brain (Mode 2) | Pixel Classifier |
| `*_brain_mask.tif` | Binary mask (0/255 uint8), un-eroded | — |

---

## Tab 2 — Create Labels

Select a `brain_only` layer produced by Tab 1. The tab shows exactly one of the two sections below, chosen automatically by the layer's filename suffix — select a different layer and it switches live:

| Active layer ends in | Section shown |
|---|---|
| `_ExtRm` | Cellpose-SAM Segmentation |
| `_NoBG` | Pixel Classifier |
| `_RndFill` | neither (presentation/visualization output only) |
| anything else | neither, with a hint on what to select |

The **Resort Labels / Remove Debris / Split Label / Join Labels / Correct Label / Copy Label to Adjacent Slice / Save Labels** tools below only appear once one of the two sections above is showing. **Tab 3 — Statistics** stays visible regardless, showing an explanatory hint instead of its controls until at least one Labels layer exists in the viewer.

### Pixel Classifier — Union-Find Labels

Fully self-contained: Gaussian smooth → threshold → per-slice 2D connected components → overlap-based union-find into 3D objects → volume filter → sequential renumber. Best on `_NoBG` layers (background removed everywhere, not just outside the brain).

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Smooth σ XY | 1.5 |
| Smooth σ Z | 3.0 |
| Min overlap (%) | 10 |
| Min volume (vox) | 7500 |

**Verify BG Threshold / Erosion (GT Sweep)** — moved to **Tab 5 — Sweeps & Utilities**; also measures the Min volume field above directly from GT (see Tab 5 for details) rather than leaving it a guessed constant.

### Cellpose-SAM Segmentation

Runs `do_3D` inference with a Cellpose-SAM checkpoint, then 3-component-GMM cleanup, a Krendl safe-merge pass (only sub-threshold fragments, gap/contact-based), and a large-contact merge pass (catches blobs split through a thick junction). Best on `_ExtRm` layers. `do_3D` inference is slow — can take hours for a full-size fish — and runs in a background thread so the UI stays responsive.

Requires a **Cellpose-SAM checkpoint** — this is a project-specific fine-tuned model, not shipped with the plugin or downloadable from a fixed URL; browse to your own trained checkpoint. The path is remembered across sessions (like the MONAI model path).

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Cellprob threshold | -2.5 |
| Flow threshold | 0.4 |
| Safe-merge max gap (vox) | 2 |
| Safe-merge min contact (vox) | 10 |
| Large-contact merge (vox) | 20 |

**Verify Cellprob / Large-contact (GT Sweep)** and **Build GT-Correction Package** — both moved to **Tab 5 — Sweeps & Utilities**.

**Re-run This Cell Only** — fixes one label without redoing the whole fish: crops to that label's own padded bounding box, re-runs `do_3D` + the same GMM/Krendl/large-contact/final-min-size cleanup on just the crop, then splices the result back in place of the old label. Only crop pieces that overlap the original label survive the splice.

### Additional tools

- **Resort Labels** — renumber 1…N by size, centroid Z/Y/X
- **Remove Debris** — sweeps the active layer for anything below the golden-ratio-relaxed volume floor, per connected fragment (not per label ID)
- **Split Label** — watershed split of a merged blob into N parts
- **Join Labels** — the inverse of Split: merges Label B into Label A
- **Correct Label** — regenerates a label's shape (2D current slice, or 3D whole cell from centroid) from the signal layer's own live contrast window (signal = intensity at/above the lower contrast limit) — optional **auto-grow**: retries with a bigger padded box if the result touches the box's own edge (catching signal a too-small pad would cut off), auto-folding in any neighboring label the growing box reaches instead of encroaching on it, capped at a configurable max number of retries
- **Copy Label to Adjacent Slice** — copies a label's shape from the current slice onto the next/previous slice, e.g. to patch a broken/missing cross-section
- **Correct Adjacent Labels** — jointly regenerates two touching labels on the current slice, cut placed by watershed seeded at each label's own existing footprint — same auto-grow option as Correct Label, seeded with both labels from the start
- **Soften label contours (sanding)** — shared Common Settings checkbox, on by default: after Correct Label, Correct Adjacent Labels, or Cellpose-SAM's own auto-correct stage, the touched label(s) get their contours smoothed (foreign-protected, purely geometric — rounds off blocky voxel edges without reshaping the cell)
- **Save Labels** — explicit file dialog (edit labels in napari before saving)

---

## Tab 3 — Statistics

Computes up to 51 features per labelled cell and exports a CSV. For what each column means, see [GUIDE.md §11](GUIDE.md#11-statistics-csv--all-columns-explained); for the algorithm/formula behind each one, see [STATISTICS_GUIDE.md](STATISTICS_GUIDE.md).

- Select a Labels layer, optionally an Image layer (intensity stats) and a Shapes layer (brain region assignment)
- Choose output columns via the per-column checklist
- Select a description backend (Rule-based / Ollama / OpenAI / Claude API)
- Click **Generate Statistics**

CSV saved as `<stem>_statistics.csv` in the output folder.

**Score Against GT** — moved to **Tab 5 — Sweeps & Utilities**; scores any two Labels layers already in the viewer against each other.

---

## Tab 4 — AI Tools

Always visible, regardless of GPU (checked once at plugin startup). A banner at the top adjusts to your GPU situation instead of hiding the tab: red/bold with no CUDA GPU ("CPU fallback — days to months for a full training run instead of hours"), amber/bold with a GPU under the recommended 8GB ("may still work with a reduced `batch_size`"), or a quiet green confirmation once the recommendation is met. GT Annotation has never needed a GPU either way. This used to be a hard gate that hid the whole tab below 8GB VRAM — changed deliberately, since a smaller or absent GPU doesn't make the tools useless, just slower or in need of a smaller `batch_size`.

An **Email notification (optional)** panel — now in **Tab 5 — Sweeps & Utilities**, General category — configures one shared set of SMTP credentials used by an "Email me when done" checkbox next to every long-running tool in the plugin (Run Skin-Remover, Cellpose-SAM Segmentation, both training launchers, and the Cellprob/Large-contact and Best-Epoch sweeps). Fill in a recipient + SMTP server/port/username/password once, then tick the checkbox on whichever tool(s) you actually want notified about — unticked tools stay silent even if the panel is configured. Leave the recipient blank to disable the feature entirely (the default). The SMTP password (and, in Tab 3, the OpenAI/Claude API key) is saved **encrypted in your OS's credential store** (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service, via `keyring`) rather than the plugin's own plaintext `config.json` — a Gmail App Password is a separate, revocable credential meant for exactly this kind of unattended use, so persisting it doesn't expose your real account password. On Linux the OS store needs an unlocked Secret Service session (GNOME Keyring/KWallet), which SSH-only sessions typically don't have; if unavailable, the plugin automatically falls back to a local Fernet-encrypted file (machine-local key, no password prompt) rather than writing anything in plaintext — a weaker guarantee than the OS store since the key sits next to the file it protects, but still not plaintext. See GUIDE.md Section 9h for the full explanation. See [How training launches work](#how-training-launches-work) below for why the training checkboxes specifically still work even if napari is never reopened (the other tools' checkboxes need napari to stay open, same as those tools themselves).

**Quickest setup, with a Gmail account (free, no other signup):**

1. Turn on [2-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/security) on your Google account, if it isn't already.
2. Generate a [Google App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) — name it anything (e.g. `napari-zf-microglia-ai`), copy the 16-character code shown. This is **not** your normal Gmail password.
3. In the panel: **Notify email** = where you want the report sent; **SMTP server** = `smtp.gmail.com` (default); **port** = `465` (default); **SMTP username** = your Gmail address; **SMTP password** = the App Password from step 2.
4. Click **Send Test Email** to confirm it works — instant, no GPU or waiting needed, reports success or the specific SMTP error right there.
5. Tick **"Email me when done"** (or **"Email me when this training run stops"**) next to whichever tool(s) you want notified about.

Any other SMTP-over-SSL (implicit TLS, not STARTTLS) provider on a fixed port works the same way, just with a different server/port — see **GUIDE.md Section 12a** for the full walkthrough, more provider examples, and a note on why STARTTLS-only providers (e.g. Office 365 on port 587) aren't currently supported.

A switch below that selects one of two mutually-exclusive groups:

### MONAI Training

- **GT Annotation** — hand-draw polygon boundaries on key slices (every ~10 slices) of a chosen Image layer, interpolate along Z (point-to-point, with propagation past a reference slice), then rasterize to `brain_mask`/`skin_mask`/`brain_only`/`skin_only` TIFFs, saved next to the source file (same `<parent>/<stem>/` convention as Tabs 1-3).
- **Prepare Training Data** — converts raw+GT fish folders into the HDF5 dataset the MONAI trainer needs.
- **Train MONAI U-Net** — launches the actual training run (hours to multiple days).

### Cellpose-SAM Training

- **Extract XZYZ Patches** — generates 2D crops in all three orientations (XY native, XZ/YZ Z-stretched to match XY's pixel scale) from a full-fish image + GT labels pair — the method every real Cellpose-SAM training dataset in this project has actually used since May 2026. **Cleans truncated incidental-neighbor labels by default**: a crop framed around one cell can graze the corner of a different nearby cell, keeping only a tiny sliver as a valid-looking (but wildly wrong-centered) training label — any label below a configurable visible-fraction threshold (default 90%) of its true full-slice size gets zeroed out automatically right after generation, backing up the crop folder first. This is the fix already applied by hand to this project's real training data on 2026-08-05, now the standing default rather than a separate step.
- **Train Cellpose-SAM** — launches fine-tuning (~20h for 200 epochs), defaulting the pretrained-checkpoint field to whatever's already loaded in Tab 2 — "continue training from where Tab 2 left off." Includes the project's branch-weighted loss option (`branch_weight`/`branch_radius`; `branch_weight=0` disables it, using the standard Cellpose loss).
- **Calibrate branch_radius (from GT)** — measures real branch thickness from a GT labels volume (3D skeleton + anisotropic distance transform, thinnest-quartile segment radius) instead of guessing `branch_radius` by hand; the recommendation is applied to the field above and saved automatically. (Kept here rather than moved to Tab 5 — it's a direct input to the training run right below it.)
- **Verify Best Epoch (GT Sweep)** — moved to **Tab 5 — Sweeps & Utilities**; confirms or corrects the recommended-checkpoint pointer against real GT.

### How training launches work

Both "Launch Training" buttons start a **detached background process** — `conda run -n <env> --no-capture-output <script> ...`, launched so it survives napari closing (POSIX `setsid()` / Windows `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | DETACHED_PROCESS`), with its own log file the GUI tails every 8 seconds. Progress and status persist to config, so **reopening napari automatically reconnects to a still-running job** instead of losing visibility into it. If the job already finished (or crashed) while napari was closed, reopening reports that outcome immediately too — "Training (PID ...) finished while napari was closed. Best ... at epoch ..." — so you're never left checking a blank status for a job that's actually long done. "Stop Training" kills the whole process tree (`conda run` spawns a child `python` process). This works identically on Windows, Linux, and Mac — no `tmux` dependency, since tmux doesn't exist natively on Windows.

**Patience (checkpoints)** — both groups have this field, and it's the *same* early-stopping rule for both: stop once N checkpoints in a row show no improvement in the model-selection metric (Full-brain Dice for MONAI, `test_loss` for Cellpose-SAM — direction handled automatically, higher-better vs. lower-better). `0` disables it. This is enforced externally by the GUI itself (parsing each script's log as checkpoints land), not by `train.py`'s own built-in `--patience` flag — the plugin always overrides that to an effectively-infinite value so there's exactly one early-stopping mechanism in play, not two different ones that happen to look similar in the UI. Also persists and resumes correctly across a napari restart, same as the rest of the job state.

**Recommended checkpoint (Cellpose-SAM only)** — MONAI's `train.py` already saves its own best checkpoint as `best_model_fullstack.pth`, so nothing extra is needed there. `train_xzyz.py` only saves periodic epoch checkpoints with no best-tracking, so whenever a Cellpose-SAM run stops (naturally or via early-stop), the GUI writes `<model_name>_best_recommended.txt` into the run's `models/` folder — a one-line pointer naming the best-`test_loss` checkpoint (e.g. `cpsam_microglia_xzyz_epoch_0150`), not a copy of the checkpoint itself and not an OS symlink (those need elevated privileges on Windows) — so it works identically cross-platform with no special permissions.

**Email notification** — unlike the log-tail/patience/recommended-checkpoint features above, this one doesn't depend on the GUI polling loop at all, and so doesn't require ever reopening napari. When that launcher's "Email me when this training run stops" checkbox is ticked (and a recipient is configured in Tab 5), the launched process is actually a small self-contained supervisor script (stdlib-only: `subprocess`/`smtplib`/`re`) that runs the real training command, waits for it to exit, parses the same log for the best checkpoint, and emails a completion report — *then* exits. Since the supervisor itself is what's detached, the email fires on its own schedule regardless of whether napari is running at that moment. Clicking "Stop Training" kills the whole process tree (supervisor included) before it reaches the email step, so a manual stop correctly sends no notification — only unattended completions/crashes do.

---

## Tab 5 — Sweeps & Utilities

Seven tools, each individually collapsible (click a section's title checkbox to hide its contents), consolidated here from Tabs 1-4 so those tabs stay focused on running the pipeline rather than tuning it. Every tool below still reads from and writes back to its *original* tab's own sliders/fields — moving where a tool is displayed doesn't change what it operates on.

**Verify MONAI Threshold / Erosion (GT Sweep)** — the cheapest of the five GT-sweep tools here: scores the brain *mask itself* (Dice/IoU/precision/recall) against a hand-corrected GT brain mask (e.g. from GT Annotation in Tab 4) — not a MONAI prediction. MONAI's sliding-window inference runs exactly once regardless of grid size; every threshold/erosion combination is a cheap re-threshold + post-process on the same probability map, so a 5×5 grid finishes in well under a minute on GPU. Needs a raw/pre-MONAI image (TIFF, not `.ims`) — feeding it an already brain-masked image would bias the very segmentation being scored. The best point found is applied directly to Tab 1's Threshold/Erosion sliders and saved.

**Verify BG Threshold / Erosion (GT Sweep)** — scores the Pixel Classifier path: sweeps Tab 1's BG Threshold x Erosion (Background mode 2) against the N most complex cells in a GT-annotated fish, scoring each grid point's resulting labels against GT. Doesn't re-run MONAI inference (takes an already-computed `brain_mask.tif` as input), so a full grid finishes in minutes and works without a GPU. Also measures **Min volume** directly from the GT's own smallest labeled cell rather than a guessed constant (the old default, a flat 7500, was smaller than some real GT cells on this project's own data — real cells were being discarded as noise). This is a **floor that only ever decreases**: applying a sweep's result takes the smaller of what was just measured and whatever's already been recommended, so one fish's sweep can never undo what an earlier fish already proved about a real cell's minimum size. A separate "Recommended minimum" label tracks this independently of the Min volume slider, which stays fully user-editable for your own experiments without corrupting that tracked value. Depends on Erosion and BG Threshold actually composing in Tab 1's pipeline — fixed as of this version.

**Verify Smooth σ XY / σ Z (GT Sweep)** — the parameter every other GT-sweep tool had already covered except this one: the Pixel Classifier's pre-threshold Gaussian smoothing had defaulted to 1.5/3.0 since Tab 2 was first built, never actually verified against real GT. Sweeps sigma XY × sigma Z against the N most complex cells with BG Threshold/Erosion held fixed at Tab 1's current values — isolates sigma specifically, the same way the Cellprob/Large-contact sweep below holds Flow fixed. Cheaper per grid point than the BG Threshold sweep, since each cell's thresholded crop is computed once and reused across every sigma combination. On this project's own D1F1 data, the sweep found a real gap: σXY=1.0/σZ=2.0 scored ~70% avg IoU vs. ~66% for the long-standing 1.5/3.0 default. Same floor-recalibration behavior for Min volume as the BG Threshold sweep. Best point applied directly to Tab 2's Smooth σ XY/Z sliders and saved.

**Verify Cellprob / Large-contact (GT Sweep)** — scores the Cellpose-SAM path: sweeps Cellprob x Large-contact against a full-fish GT labels volume, scored with the same whole-fish Hungarian-matched methodology as **Score Against GT** below — how the current defaults were actually found historically, now automated. Cellprob needs a real `do_3D` re-inference per value (GPU-preferred); Large-contact is a cheap post-processing merge threshold swept on top of one `do_3D` result per Cellprob value (reusing this project's own `--skip_inference` shortcut), so total time scales with the Cellprob axis only. Also recalibrates the Safe-merge GT-min volume parameter directly from the swept GT's own smallest labeled cell instead of a frozen historical constant. Best point and measured GT-min are both applied to Tab 2's sliders and saved.

**Verify Best Epoch (GT Sweep)** — for Cellpose-SAM training: `test_loss` (what the recommended-checkpoint pointer is based on) is only a proxy for real segmentation quality, so this finds the N most morphologically complex cells in a GT-annotated fish (ranked by skeleton branch count, not size), crops each to its bounding box, and runs `do_3D` inference at the recommended epoch plus N checkpoints below/above it (default 5 cells × 5 epochs = 25 inferences), best-IoU-matching each prediction against GT. If the sweep disagrees with the `test_loss`-based recommendation, the recommended-checkpoint pointer is rewritten to the sweep-confirmed epoch and that checkpoint is loaded as Tab 2's active model automatically. Takes roughly 30 minutes to a couple of hours; runs as a plain background thread (not detached), so unlike Launch Training it does **not** survive closing napari.

**Score Against GT** — whole-fish, Hungarian-matched instance scoring (TP/FP/FN/Score + mean IoU/Dice over matched pairs) between any two Labels layers already in the viewer. This is the `compare_pred_gt.py` methodology this project has used to validate essentially every real modeling decision, ported as a reusable tool instead of staying CLI-only. `Score = TP − 0.5×(FP + FN)`. Runs synchronously — pure CPU, no GPU needed. Distinct from the three sweep tools above: those test parameter grids against a handful of proxy cells; this scores one specific pair of label volumes completely.

**Build GT-Correction Package** — packages the most-advanced Cellpose-SAM correction stage available (sanded > auto-corrected > Krendl-only, auto-picked when the source image is browsed) into a folder + zip (source image + `cp_corrected.tif` + optional raw pre-merge masks + a lightweight per-cell CSV + `GROUND_TRUTH_CREATION_GUIDE.md`), matching the exact layout this project has hand-assembled for every fish sent out for manual GT correction. The corrected result becomes future training data via Tab 4's Extract XZYZ Patches. On-disk naming for every stage is cumulative: `cp.tif` (raw) → `cp_krendl.tif` (+Krendl) → `cp_krendl_ac.tif` (+auto-correct) → `cp_krendl_ac_snd.tif` (+sanding).

> **Calibrate branch_radius (from GT)** stayed in Tab 4 rather than moving here — it's a direct input to the Train Cellpose-SAM parameters right below it, not a standalone verification tool.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "no default model found" | Use Browse to select your `.pth` file |
| CUDA out of memory | Plugin falls back to CPU automatically |
| `conda env create` fails on Windows with `Didn't find wheel for cucim-cu12` | Fixed as of this `environment.yml` — `cucim-cu12` (Linux/WSL2-only, no Windows wheels) is now Linux-only. `git pull` if you're on an older clone; only Tab 3's GPU-batch stats path needs it, and it falls back to CPU cleanly without it |
| `.ims` files fail to open | `pip install imaris_ims_file_reader` |
| `EnvironmentFileNotFound` on `conda env update` | You must `cd` into the repo folder first |
| "Run Cellpose-SAM Segmentation" errors with `No module named 'cellpose'` | `pip install cellpose` in the `zf-microglia-ai` env (already in `environment.yml` for fresh installs) |
| Neither Tab 2 section shows up | Active layer name must end in `_ExtRm` or `_NoBG` — reselect the correct Tab 1 output layer |
| Source edits to the plugin don't take effect | You have a non-editable install — see "Developing the plugin" above |
| Tab 4 (AI Tools) shows a red/amber banner | Expected, not an error — the tab is always available regardless of GPU; the banner just sets expectations (CPU fallback, or try a lower `batch_size`) — see Tab 4 section above |
| Tab 4's "Launch Training" buttons error with script-not-found | The plugin's guessed script path is wrong for your layout — override it in `~/.config/napari-zf-microglia-ai/config.json` (see "Training scripts" above) |
