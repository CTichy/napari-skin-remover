    `fill_voids.fill(msk)` -- no size threshold anywhere in that call.
    This is the exact same category of bug create_labels() had before
    min_hole_size was added there (see _labeling.py): a single-voxel
    prediction artifact and a genuine internal structural void are

    reinstall), so this follows the same monkey-patching convention
    train_xzyz.py already uses for the branch-weighted loss: swap in a
    size-aware replacement, restore the original afterward.

    min_hole_size<=0 keeps the exact original behaviour (unconditional
    fill_voids.fill()); a positive value switches to skimage's
    area-limited remove_small_holes, applied one Z-slice at a time --
    same per-slice loop _labeling.py's 2D case needs, and for the same

    (see predict_flows()). do_3D=True is baked in -- this project's
    pipeline never uses 2D/stitch mode.

    flow_threshold is accepted only to match do_3D's own call signature and
    is a documented NO-OP here: reading cellpose/dynamics.py's
    compute_masks() shows its flow-error QC filter (remove_bad_flow_masks)
    is called only inside `if not do_3D:` -- under do_3D=True it never
    runs, confirmed both by that unconditional code-path check and by a
    call-count spy test (0 calls under do_3D=True regardless of value).
    It's kept as a parameter (rather than silently dropped) so callers
    that still pass a Flow value don't get a confusing signature error --
    it just has no effect on the result, by Cellpose's own design.

    niter=None is CellposeModel.eval()'s own public default, but eval()
    only resolves it to a real integer (200, unless diameter-based
    rescaling is active) inside its own top-level body before calling
    _compute_masks() internally -- calling _compute_masks() directly, as
    this function does, skips that resolution entirely and passes None
    straight down to dynamics.follow_flows()'s `range(niter)`, crashing
    with "TypeError: 'NoneType' object cannot be interpreted as an
    integer". This project always calls predict_flows() with
    diameter=None and no rescale, the exact case eval() itself resolves
    to niter=200, so that same value is applied here explicitly.

    Raising niter above 200 gives each voxel's flow trajectory more
    Euler-integration steps to fully converge before follow_flows() bins
    final positions into instances -- was the original hypothesis for
    the porous/"pumice stone" 3D shape (parallel banding on any given 2D
    slice) some cells show instead of a solid blob, but empirically
    (2026-08) niter alone rarely fixes it. The actual usual cause is a
    faint cell's raw cellprob map being noisy near cellprob_threshold --
    inds (the pixels follow_flows() even considers) is computed from
    that threshold *before* this function runs, so marginal, unstable
    voxels flicker in and out slice-by-slice regardless of niter. A
    stricter (higher) cellprob_threshold on that one cell (e.g. -0.3
    instead of a permissive -2.5) is the more effective lever -- see
    compute_porosity() below for a way to detect the symptom after the
    fact rather than guessing which cells need it.

    min_hole_size : passed through to _make_capped_fill_holes() -- see
    that function's docstring. 0 (default) matches cellpose's own
    unconditional hole-filling exactly.

    progress_cb(str), if given, is called once right before this step
    starts. There's no way to report finer-grained progress during it:
    neither this function nor cellpose's own follow_flows()/
    compute_masks() (checked directly in cellpose/dynamics.py) log
    anything while it runs, so without this call the entire niter-
    scaled flow-following + hole-fill + small-object-removal step is
    silent -- easy to mistake for a hang, especially at a raised niter,
    since the caller's own "Running do_3D inference..." message (see
    run_full_pipeline) already fired before the GPU network pass and
    doesn't fire again until this whole step returns.

    distance_transform_edt() was called with no sampling= argument, so it
    measured pure voxel-index distance uniformly across Z/Y/X -- but this
    project's voxels are anisotropic (Z=1.0um, XY=0.174um typical), so a
    "2 voxel" gap meant 2.0um along Z but only 0.35um in-plane, a ~5.7x
    inconsistency purely from which direction a fragment happened to

    (that stays a CLI/research workflow). Returns (labels, stats).

    progress_cb, if given, is called with a short status string before each
    stage — safe to call from a worker thread (just writes a string).

    precomputed_flows: optional (model, dP, cellprob_map, shape) tuple from
    a prior predict_flows() call on this same volume/model -- skips the
    expensive network pass entirely and goes straight to mask formation.
    Used by the Cellprob/Large-contact sweep to call this once per Cellprob
    value without re-running do_3D's network forward pass each time.

    max_gap, scale_zyx : passed through to krendl_safe_merge() -- max_gap
    is in PHYSICAL MICRONS (not voxels), scale_zyx is (Z, Y, X) um/voxel.
    See krendl_safe_merge()'s own docstring for why this matters
    (anisotropic voxels, previously un-scaled EDT).

    min_hole_size : passed through to masks_from_flows() -- see
    _make_capped_fill_holes()'s docstring. 0 (default) matches Cellpose's
    own unconditional hole-filling exactly.

    min_size : deliberately tiny early noise filter, not this project's
    Min volume floor -- kept as a separate parameter on purpose (see the
    "Common Settings" note in _widget.py). Default 15 matches Cellpose's
    own default.

    final_min_fraction : passed through to final_min_size_cleanup(), run
    as the very last stage after large-contact merge -- see that
    function's docstring for why 0.618 (golden ratio) is the default.

    niter : passed through to masks_from_flows()/run_do3d_inference() --
    see masks_from_flows()'s docstring. None (default) resolves to
    Cellpose's own default of 200.

    solidity_threshold : passed to compute_porosity(), run as the very
    last step against the final relabeled masks. 0.5 (default) is a
    conservative catch-most-real-artifacts starting point, not a
    calibrated GT-verified value (unlike this project's other
    thresholds) -- there is no GT for "is this shape porous" to
    calibrate against.

    flow_cache_path : optional path to persist predict_flows()'s
    expensive network-pass output to disk right before mask-formation
    runs -- see save_flow_cache()'s docstring for why (masks_from_flows()
    needs its own separate GPU memory and can CUDA-OOM even after the
    network pass itself already succeeded). If a cache already exists at
    this path and its fingerprint (model checkpoint, anisotropy, volume
    shape/dtype) matches this call, the network pass is skipped entirely
    and mask-formation resumes straight from the cached flows -- a stale/
    mismatched cache is detected and ignored, never silently reused. The
    cache file is deleted automatically once masks_from_flows() succeeds;
    it only survives a crash in that specific step. Ignored when
    precomputed_flows is already given (that already skips the network
    pass via a different, in-memory-only mechanism, for the sweep tools).
