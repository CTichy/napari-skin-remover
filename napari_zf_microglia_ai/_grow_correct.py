_grow_correct.py -- auto-growing wrapper around Correct Label / Correct
Adjacent Labels: retries the same threshold-based correction with a
progressively larger padded working region whenever the result's own
footprint touches the edge of that region -- catching real signal that
too small a pad would otherwise cut off. Also auto-detects when growth
reveals a neighboring label and expands into a joint multi-label
correction so a neighbor's territory is never wrongly consumed -- this
never grows silently into someone else's cell.

2D mode reuses correct_label_group_2d() directly (a single-ID call
degenerates to plain single-label correction, so one function already
covers both the 1-label and N-label case uniformly).

3D mode reuses the same two-pass architecture auto_contrast_correct_stack()
already uses for a whole fish (Pass 1: correct_label_from_intensity_3d()
independently per label; Pass 2: touching_groups_for_stack() +
correct_label_group_2d() wherever the independently-corrected labels now
touch) -- just scoped to the growing local group instead of every label
in the fish, and re-run from the ORIGINAL labels each attempt rather than
compounding one attempt on top of the last.

Neighbor discovery (both modes) is deliberately narrow on two axes, to
stop it ever cascading into an unrelated part of the fish:

1. Only GENUINE TOUCHING adjacency counts, never mere presence nearby
   -- a "how much padding is there room for" search would otherwise
   keep finding *something* within an ever-growing box indefinitely.
2. Only the ORIGINALLY-REQUESTED label(s)' own touches are ever
   examined -- once a neighbor is folded into the group purely to
   protect its own territory near the target, that neighbor's own
   touches elsewhere are never looked at. A large/sprawling label
   folded in this way can easily touch several other, completely
   unrelated cells somewhere else in the fish; without this
   restriction, discovering it would cascade the group into all of
   those too, and then whatever THEY touch, and so on.

In 3D, Pass 2 only ever runs once a given attempt found zero new
neighbors this way; if it does find one, the whole attempt is redone
from scratch with the bigger group instead of applying Pass 2 to a
group that might still be missing a member.
